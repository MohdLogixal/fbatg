With this project we aim to produce an ATG module that allows anyone with a Facebook account to seamlessly log in into an ATG application, bypassing the account creation step.

For the end user, the main advantage is that another, potentially redundant set of credentials is not needed. For the application publisher, the main advantage in our view is the simplification of the account creation process (which may lead to increased conversions for example), followed by the interactivity and social network features available via the Facebook API.

The demonstration application simply displays log in and logout links which use the Facebook Connect API, and shows the user full name and Facebook profile picture once successfully logged in.
